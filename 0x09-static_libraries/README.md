Remember the stages of compilation



    Preprocessing



    Compilation



    Assembly



    Linking



An object file is a file that has not gone through the last stage of compilation - linking.



To create object files we need to invoke gcc with the -c option.



$ ls

add.c

subtract.c

$ gcc -c add.c subtract.c

$ ls

add.c

add.o

subtract.c

subtract.o



    object files usually end with .o



2. Use ar to create a library



ar is the command we use to create libraries. We need to tell ar the name of the library we want to create.



Let's call our library "calculate" ðŸ˜Ž.



$ ar -rc libcalculate.a add.o subtract.o

$ ls

add.c

add.o

libcalculate.a

subtract.c

subtract.o



    libraries usually start with lib end with .a, hence libcalculate.a



What does the -rc mean??



Well, it tells ar to create a new libcalculate.h library if it doesn't exist, but if it does, it should recreate the library.

3. Index the library



This step is optional but pretty useful. When you index a library, you generate an index containing all the cool stuffs in the library. Which makes linking very fast!

How do you index a library??



by using a command called ranlib like this



$ ranlib libcalculate.h



4. Use your library ðŸ•º



But first you need to do on little thing.



*Create an header file containing the prototypes of all the functions in your library, easy!.



Inside our calcute.h header file...



int add(int a, int b);



int subtract(int a, int b);



Pheew!, finally.



#include "calculate.h"

#include <stdio.h>



int main(void)

{

    int a = 5;

    int b = 3;

    int result;



    result = add(a, b);

    printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, result);

    result = subtract(a, 3);

    printf("%d - %d = %d\n", a, b, result);



    return (0);

}



How do you compile??



Easy! You just need to tell gcc where to find your library and the name of you library.



$ gcc main.c -L . -l calculate



        The -L option tells gcc where to find your library, and we supplied . which means your current working directory



        The -l option tells gcc the name of the library without the lib prefix and the .a suffix



$ ./a.out

5 + 3 = 8

5 - 3 = 2



Tasks

0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life



Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed below:



int _putchar(char c);

int _islower(int c);

int _isalpha(int c);

int _abs(int n);

int _isupper(int c);

int _isdigit(int c);

int _strlen(char *s);

void _puts(char *s);

char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);

int _atoi(char *s);

char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);

char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);

char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);

int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);

char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);

char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);

char *_strchr(char *s, char c);

unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);

char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);

char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);



library

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future



Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
